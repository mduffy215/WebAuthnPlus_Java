         If the resource is configured with a password attribute and either a mail.smtp.user or mail.user attribute then 
         Tomcat's resource factory will configure and add a javax.mail.Authenticator to the mail session.
         
         Unpackage the distribution and place mail.jar into $CATALINA_HOME/lib so that it is available to Tomcat during the 
         initialization of the mail Session Resource. Note: placing this jar in both $CATALINA_HOME/lib and a web application's 
         lib folder will cause an error, so ensure you have it in the $CATALINA_HOME/lib location only.
